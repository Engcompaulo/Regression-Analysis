# Regression Analysis

Regression Analysis (RA) is a powerful tool to modelling the relationship between two or more variable. Here you'll find a implementations of differents RA models such as Simple Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression and Logistic Regressions. Each one of these models has many properties and are applicable in a huge set of problems.

But we'll not stop on the implementation of the model. At each notebook, while implementing the model, we will try to answer:

	1. How to quantify the performance of the regression?
	2. What are the determinants of a good regression?
	3. How many variables should I use in the model?
	4. How powerful is the model?
